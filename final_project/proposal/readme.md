# Final Project Proposal

## Project Description

For my final project, I am hoping to create a working game in which a player-controlled UFO will try to abduct cows without being seen by a patrolling farmer. The cows will walk about randomly in a square pasture, the farmer will walk around the perimeter of the pasture, the UFO will be controlled with the arrow keys, and a UFO abduction beam will be controlled with the space bar. If the farmer sees the UFO while the abduction beam is active, then the game will restart. My plan is to use basic shapes to represent the different objects in my game. If things go extraordinarily well, then I might be able to use images or even sound effects.

## Inspirations

Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing flash games on the internet. Most of them were bad, but occasionally I came across a good on which would keep me entertained for hours. I am hoping to create a game like one of the games I wasted hours playing as a kid. It probably will not be one of the good ones, but I am hoping it will at least be functional.
My plan is to use a sort of isometric view point to give the player an illusion of three dimensionality. This kind of view point is inspired by games like *Bastion* and *Transistor*, both made by Super Giant Games. Using this point of view will allow me to show elements, like the abduction beam, that would otherwise be hidden in a top down perspective.

## Possible Problems

The biggest problem I can foresee is getting all my different objects to interact with each other correctly. I want to create different classes for the different types of objects in my proposed project. However, when I tried to get objects created from different classes to interact in homework assignment 12, I was unsuccessful.
If things do go exceptionally well and I do have time to replace shapes with images, then another new technique I will have to learn is how to set up a local server and how to use images in my code. I read through the corresponding lessons, but because there was no homework assignment associated with them, I have neither set up a local server before, nor have I used images in my code projects.

## Work Plan

The deadline, December 11, is much closer than I realized. But I still think that I will be able to implement most of the core features that I want before the deadline. My deadlines are as follows:

* 12/02/18
	* Create three separate classes from which to create different objects
	* The objectâ€™s non-interactive functions should work by this point as well
* 12/07/18
	* Objects should interact with each other as intended
* 12/08/18
	* First draft of readme.md should be written
	* Additional non-essential functions may be added
* 12/10/18
	* Final check to make sure everything is working correctly
	* Final draft of readme.md should be written
	* Project should be submitted to moodle web page

Because of my previous problems in getting objects created from different classes to interact with each other, I have allocated most of my time to making sure my objects interact with each other properly. I am hoping that I will not need all my allotted time for object interactions so that I can focus some more on making my objects look, or maybe even sound, better. I do plan on starting with very basic shapes, ellipses, to represent my different objects at first. Once the ellipses interact with each other like I want them too, then I will add more details to make them look like a UFO, cows, or a farmer.

## Current Progress

As of writing this, I have yet to formerly start my project. However, I have experimented with interactive pieces in previous homework assignments. For example, I have created objects that move based on if the arrow key is pressed or not, and I even designed a UFO in one of the earlier assignments.
