## Summary

This week, I followed the lesson instructions and downloaded two programs:

-[Atom](https://atom.io/)

-[Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

As all of the material covered in the first two weeks of class have been entirely new to me, I have tried to follow the instructions as closely as possible. I think I have been successful so far, but I often feel overwhelmed.

## Steps Taken

1. Read through lesson pages and watched lesson videos.
2. Downloaded and installed Atom.
3. Deleted and reinstalled Atom because I forgot to run the program as an administrator.
4. Downloaded and installed Github Desktop.
5. Connected Github Desktop to Atom and my online github account.
6. Used gitbash to make a new readme.md
7. Tried to use gitbash to move my newly created readme.md to a different directory but instead changed its name.
8. Reviewed unix for the beginning mage pdf.
9. Finally renamed and moved readme.md to correct directory.
10. Wrote up my homework assignment in Atom.
11. Copied and pasted my work into Microsoft Word to check for spelling mistakes.
12. Submitted my homework assingment.

## Issues

1. I still don't feel super confident using gitbash.
2. I'm not 100% sure I know where to post about issues.
  - Is it in the same place where we answered the first questions about creative coding?
  - If nobody else posted an issue, how can I try and help someone as is required?
3. Another requirement for the homework write up is to include inline code and while I can, in theory, format code correctly in markdown, I have no idea how to actually code anything.

## Hoping to Discuss Further:

-more Gitbash commands

-p5.js
