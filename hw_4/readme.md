[Self Portrait]()

# Homework Assignment 4

## Intro

This week was a lot of fun! While watching and reading through this week's lesson, I felt a little overwhelmed by the amount of different functions being presented. However, once I started my own project and took some time to experiment and play around, I found that most of the functions were straight forward to use and that coding was enjoyable. At some point while coding my project I stopped for a break and discovered that what felt like 30 minutes of coding had actually been three hours of coding! I did find using a couple of the functions difficult at first; not so difficult that they were discouraging, but instead difficult in the way an enjoyable challange is difficult.

## Work

This week I chose to sketch a self-portrait using p5.js shape, line, and color functions. I would break my work flow down into the following steps:

1. Drew a sketch with pen and paper.
2. Grouped different parts of the sketch together based on what order they would have to be coded to ensure they were visible.
3. Tried writing the code.
4. Tested the code I had written.
5. Revised the code.
  - I repeated steps 4, and 5 after line of code written.

I started with the mouth first as I had decided it would be the top-most layer. Using three seperate ellipses, and increasingly darker shades of purple, I was able to give the mouth some semblance of depth.

The next body segment I worked on were the teeth. I broke the 'teeth problem' down into two seperate sub-problems as well: inner-teeth and outer-teeth. While the

 'traingle();'

 function may have been easier to use, I felt like the 'arc();' function created much better teeth shapes.
